=== `+WITH+`

The `+WITH+` keyword allows you to bind names to values for the lifetime of a query. This can be useful in situations where you want the same value to be used for every row in a table. One example is conditioning a model for use in a `+SELECT+` expression.

====
[gensql]
----
WITH (satellites_model CONDITIONED BY VAR Users = "Military") AS military_model:
  SELECT PROBABILITY OF VAR Apogee_km > Apogee_km UNDER military_model
