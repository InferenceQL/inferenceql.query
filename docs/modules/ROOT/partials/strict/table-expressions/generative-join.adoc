=== `+GENERATIVE JOIN+`

The `+GENERATIVE JOIN+` expression evaluates to a table by combining a model and a table. Like a join in SQL, a generative join returns a new, larger table. Unlike a join between two tables in SQL, a generative join takes a data table and joins it with conditional samples from a model.
